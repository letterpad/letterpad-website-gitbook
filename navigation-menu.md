# Navigation Menu

The navigation menu is another important part of Letterpad. It is responsible to show how you want to display your content. As an example, lets say your sitename is `demo.letterpad.app`.

If your url is `demo.letterpad.app/tag/travel`, Letterpad knows that you want to display all the posts which are tagged with `travel`.&#x20;

If your url is `demo.letterpad.app/page/about-me`, Letterpad knows that you want to display the About Me page.

If your url is `demo.letterpad.app/post/travelling-in-paris`, Letterpad knows that you want to display the post Travelling In Paris.

But if your url is `demo.letterpad.app`, Letterpad has no idea if you want to display a page or a collection of posts.&#x20;

Navigation solves this problem.

Click on Settings => Navigation to bring up the navigation section.

You can change the label to anything meaningful. It will be display in your homepage. In Path, when you open the dropdown, it categories between Tags and Pages. If you select a tag, it will display all the posts linked with that tag.

You can add more items to the navigation menu.&#x20;

If I visit the site, it will look like this.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The navigation menu is something that you don't touch often. Once you have configured it, it's all about writing content and adding the right tags to your post. The navigation menu will automatically link them.
{% endhint %}
