# Post vs Pages

Letterpad has the concept of posts and pages, just like Wordpress and Blogger. The difference between posts and pages are as follows.

Posts are the entries that are displayed in reverse chronological order on your home page \(or other listing page like categories\).

In contrast to pages, posts have comment fields beneath them and are included in your site's RSS feed. Think of them as moving content.

Pages are similar to posts, but there are some key differences.

Pages are for content that that doesn’t change very much. Think of them as static content. Pages are for “non-blog” content. If you were to remove all of your blog posts, and leave just the pages, you would have a standard static web site. Pages cannot be associated with Categories and cannot be assigned Tags. Pages are not included in your site's RSS feed.
