# Introduction

Letterpad is an open source blog publishing engine with a state-of-the-art technology. It has been built using next.js. It uses Graphql to interact with the API and uses sqlite3 as the default database. 

This documentation is designed to suit users who are reasonably confident working with a JavaScript technology stack, and deploying their own web applications. We also have a installer script that can install Letterpad and all its dependencies including the server in one go. In any situation, if you are stuck, feel free to reach out to us [through these channels](channels.md).

Letterpad is a tiny project in terms of the number of people actively working on it. We have ambitious plans for what we're trying to do and we need to focus on delivering a useful product. Any little contribution from your side would mean a lot to us.

### Why Letterpad ?

Blogging has been a part of our lives from a very long time. There are so many great options available but still we felt the need of a system which is not very commercial, ad-free, heavily performant, minimalistic and good looking. Most of the platforms has been developed with great features, but as a independent blogger we felt the need of system which has a smaller footprint. And with that Letterpad was developed. 

Letterpad can be used as a platform or in your server. We also provide you with a client which is also made with next.js, but you can create your own client in any language you want.
